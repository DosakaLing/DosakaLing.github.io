# The purpose of external audit engagements

## The Objective of external audit

- 审计财报的目的：
  - Enable the auditor to express an **independent opinion** on whether the financial statements are prepared, **in all material respects**, in accordance with an **applicable financial reporting framework**.
  - That **opinion**: whether the financial statements are **presented fairly**, in all material respect, or give a **true and fair view** in accordance with the framework. Based on ISAs and other relevant ethical requirements.
  - By-products: Like advice to the directors on how to run the business. But its objective is solely to report to the shareholders.

# Accountability, stewardship and agency

- The reason why audit provides **assurance** to the shareholders and other stakeholders of a company on the financial statements because it is independent and impartial.

## Accountability:

- The quality or state of being accountable; that is, being required or expected to **justify actions and decisions**. It suggests an obligation or willingness to **accept responsibility** for one's action.

## Stewardship:

- Stewardship refers to the duties and obligations of a person who **manages another person's property**.

## Agency:

- Agents are people employed or used to **provide a particular service**. In the case of a company, the people being used to provide the service of managing the business also have the second role of **trying to maximize their personal wealth** in their own right.

## Assurance provision:

- one in which a **practitioner** expresses a conclusion designed to enhance the degree of **confidence** of the intended **users** other than the **responsible party** about the **subject matter** information (that is, the outcome of the evaluation or measurement of a subject matter against criteria.)

- Elements of an assurance:

| engagement                 | CREST                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| suitable criteria          | criteria                 |
| a subject matter           | report                   |
| evidence                   | evidence                 |
| a subject matter           | subject matter           |
| a three party relationship | three party relationship |

## Responsibility of external auditor:

- obtain **reasonable assurance** about whether the financial statement **as a whole** are free from  **material** misstatement whether due to **fraud or error**
- reasonable assurance:
  - high level of assurance: obtained when the auditor has obtained **sufficient appropriate evidence** to **reduce audit risk**.
  - audit risk: the risk that the auditor expresses an inappropriate opinion when the financial statements are materially misstated to an acceptably low level. (审计师发表了不合适观点，当财报有严重错误)
  - **not an absolute level of assurance**: inherent(固有的) limitations of an audit which result in most of the audit evidence on which the auditor draws conclusions and bases the auditor's opinion being **persuasive rather than conclusion**.
