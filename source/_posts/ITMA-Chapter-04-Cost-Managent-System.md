# Direct Cost

## Definition

- identify direct costs specifically and exclusively with  a given cost object in an economically feasible way

## Characteristics

- physically identify the amount of the cost that relates exclusively to a particular cost object.

> tracing the direct cost to the cost object

# Indirect Cost

## Definition

- Indirect costs cannot be identified specifically and exclusively with a given cost objective in an economically feasible way.
- Assign indirect costs to cost objects

## Examples

- facilities rental costs, depreciation on equipment, and many staff salaries

# Cost Allcation
## Definition
- Cost allocation assigns indirect costs to cost objects, in proportion to the cost object’s use of a particular cost-allocation base.
- base is some measure of input or output that determines the amount of cost to be allocated to a  particular cost object.
- 通常就是cost driver
- Why need?
  - strategic decision
  - operational control
  - external reporting
- pruposes:
  - predict economic effects
    - setting the optimal product and customer mix, pricing policy, chose value-chain function to develop as core competencies
    - predict the economic benefits and costs of process improvement efforts
  - provide desired motivation and feedback for performance evaluation
  - compute income and asset valuations for financial accounting
  - justify costs or obtain reimbursement

## Example

- Dell: 

{%asset_img dell.png%}

## Selection

- base should be **a measure of how much of the particular cost is caused by the cost objective**
- At most circumstances: most allocation bases are **cost drivers**

# Method of Allocation Costs

- direct costs: tracing
- indirect costs: allocate using a cost-allocation base

## Cost Pool
### Definition
- Individual costs allocated to cost objects using a single cost-allocation base.

## Steps

- Accumulate indirect costs for a period of time
- select an **allocation base**
- 计量每一个product使用了多少cost-allocation base
-  按照数量的比例分配cost pool中的成本到单个产品

## Examples

# Unallocated Cost

- might include R&D, legal design, accounting...
- just leave them alone

### Examples

# For External Reporting Purposes

- 成本会计系统的目的之一就是提供存货的度量和COGS的度量
- Four Attributes
  - Manufacturing costs
  - Product versus period costs
  - Costs on the balance sheet
  - Costs on the income statement

# Manufacturing Costs

- Direct-material costs
- Direct-labor costs
- Indirect production costs(Overhead)

## Merchandising Company

## Comparing

- Current Assets

- Inventory

- COGS

# Activity-Based Management

## Definition

- Using the output of an activity-based cost accounting system to aid strategic decision making and to improve operational control
- A value-added cost should be included
- Nonvalue-added costs can be eliminated without affecting a product's value to the customer

## Benchmarking

- continuous process of comparing products, services and activities to the best industry standards

# Benefits of ABC

- set an optimal product mix
- estimate profit margins of new products
- determine consumption of shared resources
- keep pace with new product techniques
- keep pace with technological changes
- decrease costs associated with bad decisions
- take advantage of reduced cost of ABC systems due to computer technology

# To design an ABC system

- Determine the key components of the cost accounting system
  - cost objectives（成本对象：比如commercial和residential顾客 ）
  - key activities（主要要从事哪些业务活动，形成activity dictionary）
  - resources （每个activity需要消耗的资源，以及企业本身的资源）
  - related cost drivers（成本和行为之间的因果关系，把resource和activity联系起来的，把activity和objective联系起来的成本动因）
- Determine relationships among cost objectives, activities, and resources
- Collect relevant data concerning costs and the physical flow of the cost-driver units among resources and activities
- calculate and interpret the new activity-based information
  - determine the traceable costs for each of the activity cost pools
  - Determine the activity-based cost for account for each customer class.

# Design of a Traditional Costing System

- 将间接成本只按一个cost driver 分配
