When you have finished studying this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Explain how activity cost drivers affect cost behavior.
2. Show how changes in cost driver levels affect variable and fixed costs.
3. Calculate break-even sales volume in total dollars and total units.
4. Create a cost-volume-profit graph and understand the assumptions behind it.
5. Calculate sales volume in total dollars and total units to reach a target profit.
6. Differentiate between contribution margin and gross margin.
7. Explain the effects of sales mix on profits (Appendix 2A).
8. Compute cost-volume-profit relationships on an after-tax basis (Appendix 2B).

# Cost Drivers and Cost Behavior

## Definitions

- Cost drivers are measures of activities that require the use of resources and thereby cause costs.

- Cost behavior is how the activities of an organization affect its costs.

## Examples

### Value Chain Function

Research and development

- Salaries of sales personnel, costs of market surveys

- Salaries of product and process engineers

Design of products, services, and processes

- Salaries of product and process engineers
- Cost of computer-aided design equipment used to develop prototype of product for testing

Production

- Labor wages

- Supervisory salaries

- Maintenance wages

- Depreciation of plant and machinery, supplies

- Energy cost

Marketing

- Cost of advertisements

- Salaries of marketing personnel, travel costs, entertainment costs

Distribution

- Wages of shipping personnel

- Transportation costs including depreciation of vehicles and fuel

Customer service

- Salaries of service personnel

- Costs of supplies, travel

Example of Cost Drivers:

- Number of new product proposals

- Complexity of proposed products

- Number of engineering hours

- Number of distinct parts per product

- Labor hours

- Number of people supervised

- Number of mechanic hours

- Number of machine hours

- Kilowatt hours

- Number of advertisements

- Sales dollars

- Labor hours

- Weight of items delivered

- Hours spent servicing products

- Number of service calls

## Relevant Range

### Definition

- The relevant range is the limit of cost-driver activity level within which a specific relationship between costs and the cost driver is valid.
- Even within the relevant range, a fixed cost remains fixed only over a given period of time -- usually the budget period.

# CVP Scenario

- The study of the effects of **output volume on revenue(sales)**, **expenses(costs)**, and **net income(net profit)**.

## Break-Even Point

- the level of sales at which revenue equals expenses and net income is zero.

## Target Net Profit

- Formula: $Target Sales Volume In Units = \frac{Fixed expenses + Target net income}{Contribution margin per unit}$
- contribution margin ratio =  unit contribution / selling price
- Sales volume in dollars = fixed expenses+target net income/contribution margin ratio

- An example:
  - {%asset_img nonprofit.png%}

## Margin of Safety

- How far sales can fall before losses occur and is the difference between the level of planned sales and the break-even point.
- margin of safety in units = planned unit sales - break-even unit sales

# Operating Leverage

- A firm's ratio of fixed costs to variable costs
